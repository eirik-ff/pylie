# pylie
A small Lie library for Python.

This library represents rotations and poses in 3D.
It also implements group and Lie operations, as well as their Jacobians.

## Install library
You can install this library to your Python environment directly from this repository using `pip`:
```bash
pip install https://github.com/tussedrotten/pylie/archive/master.zip
```

This library depends upon numpy.
The examples and tests have further dependencies, see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
